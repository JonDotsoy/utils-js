## How to add tools

This project contains a set of tools to help developers write less code. Each tool requires a minimal structure. Please read the following steps:

1. Describe a new tool with a name. Example `set`
2. Create a file in this location `./src/${name}/${name}.ts`. Example: `./src/set/set.ts`
3. Write your logic in this file
4. Submit a new proposal here: https://github.com/JonDotsoy/utils-js/pulls
